# LLM-based applications
This repository contains applications built based on Large Language Models (GPT-4, ChatGPT, and LLAMA). 

## Meeting Summarizer
Summarizes a meeting or a conversation based on an input transcript. 

## PDF Summarizer
Upload a PDF document and summarize it in language of choice. 

## POC Builder / Code Generator
Generates code for any given use-case using GPT-4. Enables users to specify their requirements in natural language, 
and creates a webapp using Streamlit. Provided an experimental solution to quickly build POCs using LLMs. 

```
Examples of use-cases:
# Create an app using which users can upload pdf documents, that are then summarized by chatgpt
# Create a sample streamlit app with dataframe, static table, line chart, and scattarplot
# Create an app using which a user can upload pdf documents. There should be a button to get a summary. There should a text area where a user can add some natural language instructions. These instructions should be processed by AI and then used to create bar or pie charts, if the user clicks on appropriate buttons.

```

## Wikipedia AI-Interface
Provides a natural language interface to Wikipedia. Enables users to ask questions via voice or 
have a multi-turn interaction via a text-based chat. The webapp is built using Streamlit.
